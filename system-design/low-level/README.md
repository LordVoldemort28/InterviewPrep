There are three types of design pattern 

Creational Design Pattern
------------------------
Creational patterns provides essential information regarding the Class instantiation or the object instantiation. Class Creational Pattern and the Object Creational pattern is the major categorization of the Creational Design Patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory Method 
- Builder Method
- Prototype Method
- Singleton Method

## Approach
- Understand requirements
  - Use Case
- Diagram
  - Nouns(Objects)
  - Relationship(How each objects are interacting with each other)
- Code
  - Interfaces(APIs)
  - Model(Objects)
  - Services(Implementing use cases)

## Metrics
 - This competency measure your ability to write maintainable, reusable, readable and understandable code
 - Feel free to write our examples(dumb code) for how your code will be used. If its seems overly complex, go back and think if that's how you'd want your coworker to use their code, and if there are ways to simplify it.
 - Time is precious; rather than thinking complex or optimal solution start with a working solution, no matter how simple and enhance it as you go.
 - Think about extendibility, make sure you are able to extend the code when/if requirements change, avoid single function that does everything. 
 -  Separate out functionality into discrete methods/functions with clear responsibility.
