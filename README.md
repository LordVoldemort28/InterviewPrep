Stanford Lecture
------------------
* Memorizing solutions is not the best strategy for preparing for interviews. Its good for contest programming is very different from what you’ll need for job interviews and what you’ll actually do the job
* Practice software engineering methods
* Build professional network
* Observe certain flavour of organisation culture
* Impact of your work 
* Life enjoyment at work and/or balance with life outside work
* It is in the best interest of both you and the resume reader or interviewer that you have as high bandwidth communication as possible
* Reaching out to the recruiter 
* Be honest on your resume so they don’t your honesty
* Practice to speak your resume smartly and efficiently 
* Project workshop 
* Review each others resume
