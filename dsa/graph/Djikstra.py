"""
Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm. 
This algorithm will run until all vertices in the graph have been visited.
This mean that the shortest path between any two nodes can be saved and looked up after.

Limitation: Doesn't work on negative weights

"""
Pseudocode 

1. From the starting node, visited the vertex with the smallest know distance/cost
2. Once we're  moved to the lowest cost vertex, check each of its neighboring nodes
3. Calculate the distance/cost for the neighboring nodes by summing the cost of the edges
leading from the start vertex
4. If the distance/cost to a vertex we are checking is less than a know distance, update
the shortest distance from that vertex

Time complexity: O(|E| log |E| ) = O(|E| 2 log |V|) = O(|E| log |V|) with heap
